# PERSONALIZED FITNESS AND NUTRITION INSIGHTS

The project develops a Big Data system that integrates data from wearable devices, nutrition apps and user demographics.

Through streaming pipelines and machine learning algorithms, it delivers personalized fitness and nutrition recommendations that adapt in real time to users’ behavior and progress.

Key objectives:
- Build a real-time data pipeline that manages different types of data: sensor-based inputs from wearables and self-reported data from users.
- Develop a personalized recommendation engine that continuously adapts to user adherence and progress.

Main results achieved:
- Designed and implemented a real-time streaming pipeline using MQTT, Kafka, Spark Structured Streaming, Redis, CockroachDB and MinIO, organized across different storage layers.  
- Developed a recommendation algorithm for workouts and nutrition plans, leveraging both users’ historical data and collective feedback from other users to continuously refine suggestions.  
- Built an interactive dashboard that provides multiple functionalities, including real-time monitoring and visualization of key health and fitness metrics and sensor management.

## Data Pipeline and Infrastructure
<img width="2048" height="1399" alt="system architecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/034bb336-3f4a-4603-8565-e4b81e95b4cf" />


---

Semi-structured data flows through **streaming brokers** (e.g., **Kafka** or **MQTT**) for near-real-time processing, and get structured via the delta-table format in a data lakehouse in minio.  
Structured data is ingested from **relational databases**.

### Processing Layer
The processing layer handles real-time transformations, cleaning, and enrichment of ingested data
- Streaming jobs (e.g., **Spark Structured Streaming**) validate, normalize, and pre-aggregate activity, nutrition, and sensor data.
- Processing ensures quality, consistency, and prepares data for downstream storage.
- Domain-specific transformations are applied (e.g., unit conversion, outlier filtering, activity/nutrition enrichment).


### Storage Layer

This layer provides **durable, structured storage** for both raw and processed data:
- Semi-structured logs are ingested into the datalakehouse and persisted in an object store (MinIO) using the Delta Lake table format
- Structured datasets are stored in **relational stores** (CockroachDB) for transactional queries.
- Redis or caching layers may be used for fast access to device configurations or session-based values.

### Aggregation Layer
At this stage, diverse data sources are **combined and aligned** to provide a holistic view of the user:
- Activity, nutrition, sensor streams are joined with profile, demographic, and device data.
- Feedback loops are integrated to refine the aggregation (user adherence, preferences).
- Aggregated datasets are stored in curated tables for direct consumption by models.

### Model Layer

This layer is responsible for **personalization and intelligence**
- Machine learning models (trained on historical user clusters, behavior, and demographics) generate:
    - Personalized **workout recommendations**
    - Personalized **nutrition plans**
- Feedback data is continuously integrated to retrain/update models (adaptive learning).
- Models are deployed as services, accessible through APIs for the frontend.

### Serving Layer
The **Serving Layer** is the bridge between storage systems (SQL + object store) and the UI (Streamlit). It provides **low-latency APIs** that expose KPIs, recommendations, and model outputs to the frontend. It is created with fastAPI

### Visualization Layer

The final layer delivers insights and recommendations back to the end-user:
- A **dashboard (Streamlit or web frontend)** displays:
    - Daily energy balance (calories consumed vs. burned)
    - Progress on workouts and nutrition adherence
    - Personalized recommendations (workouts, meals)
- Users can provide **feedback** directly in the UI, which flows back into the ingestion layer to improve future recommendations.
- The user can login, logout, sign in, change settings, change sensor or wearables and much more
